<p>Utility bundles</p>

<p>Note:</p>
<p>We switch our OSGi Projects to SpringBoot and do not need some of the artifacts in the util package any longer.
These artifacts are not deprecated but they are currently not under development.</p>

<p>The packages we use are:<p>
<p>org.i3xx.util.basic<br>
org.i3xx.util.qtuple<p>
